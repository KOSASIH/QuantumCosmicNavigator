# Asteroid/Comet Trajectory Prediction

## Introduction
This Python script uses AI techniques to predict the trajectory of asteroids and comets in our solar system. It takes as input the orbital parameters of the celestial object and outputs the predicted positions of the object at different time intervals.

## Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install numpy scipy scikit-learn
   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries in your Python script:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   from scipy.integrate import odeint
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   ```

3. Define the initial conditions and orbital parameters of the celestial object:
   ```python
   # Initial conditions
   initial_position = [x0, y0, z0]
   initial_velocity = [vx0, vy0, vz0]

   # Orbital parameters
   semi_major_axis = a
   eccentricity = e
   inclination = i
   longitude_of_ascending_node = Omega
   argument_of_periapsis = omega
   mean_anomaly = M
   ```

4. Define the differential equations for the celestial object's motion:
   ```python
   def motion_equations(state, t):
       x, y, z, vx, vy, vz = state

       r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)

       ax = -G * (M / r**3) * x
       ay = -G * (M / r**3) * y
       az = -G * (M / r**3) * z

       return [vx, vy, vz, ax, ay, az]
   ```

5. Solve the differential equations using the `odeint` function:
   ```python
   t = np.linspace(0, time_interval, num_time_steps)
   initial_state = initial_position + initial_velocity
   states = odeint(motion_equations, initial_state, t)
   ```

6. Predict the future positions of the celestial object using a linear regression model:
   ```python
   regression_model = LinearRegression()
   regression_model.fit(t.reshape(-1, 1), states[:, :3])

   future_t = np.linspace(time_interval, future_time_interval, num_future_time_steps)
   future_positions = regression_model.predict(future_t.reshape(-1, 1))
   ```

7. Output the predicted positions of the celestial object at different time intervals:
   ```python
   print("Time\tX\tY\tZ")
   for t, position in zip(future_t, future_positions):
       print(f"{t:.2f}\t{position[0]:.2f}\t{position[1]:.2f}\t{position[2]:.2f}")
   ```

## Example
Here's an example usage of the script:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Initial conditions
initial_position = [1, 0, 0]
initial_velocity = [0, 1, 0]

# Orbital parameters
semi_major_axis = 1.0
eccentricity = 0.5
inclination = 0.0
longitude_of_ascending_node = 0.0
argument_of_periapsis = 0.0
mean_anomaly = 0.0

# Define the differential equations for motion
def motion_equations(state, t):
    x, y, z, vx, vy, vz = state

    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)

    ax = -G * (M / r**3) * x
    ay = -G * (M / r**3) * y
    az = -G * (M / r**3) * z

    return [vx, vy, vz, ax, ay, az]

# Solve the differential equations
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
initial_state = initial_position + initial_velocity
states = odeint(motion_equations, initial_state, t)

# Predict future positions using linear regression
regression_model = LinearRegression()
regression_model.fit(t.reshape(-1, 1), states[:, :3])

future_t = np.linspace(10, 20, 100)
future_positions = regression_model.predict(future_t.reshape(-1, 1))

# Output the predicted positions
print("Time\tX\tY\tZ")
for t, position in zip(future_t, future_positions):
    print(f"{t:.2f}\t{position[0]:.2f}\t{position[1]:.2f}\t{position[2]:.2f}")
```

This script predicts the trajectory of an object with initial position (1, 0, 0) and initial velocity (0, 1, 0) for a time interval of 10 to 20 units. The predicted positions are printed in a tabular format.

To develop an AI-powered algorithm that analyzes spectroscopic data from telescopes to determine the chemical composition of celestial objects, you can use machine learning techniques. Here's an example of how you can approach this task using Python and scikit-learn library:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load the spectroscopic data
spectra = np.loadtxt('spectra_data.txt', delimiter=',')

# Load the corresponding object names
object_names = np.loadtxt('object_names.txt', dtype=str)

# Load the chemical element labels
chemical_elements = np.loadtxt('chemical_elements.txt', dtype=str)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_data = spectra[:800]
train_labels = object_names[:800]
test_data = spectra[800:]
test_labels = object_names[800:]

# Train a random forest classifier
classifier = RandomForestClassifier()
classifier.fit(train_data, train_labels)

# Predict the object names for the test data
predicted_labels = classifier.predict(test_data)

# Create a markdown table to display the results
result_table = "| Object Name | "
for element in chemical_elements:
    result_table += element + " | "
result_table += "\n| --- |"
for _ in range(len(chemical_elements)):
    result_table += " --- |"
result_table += "\n"

for i in range(len(test_labels)):
    result_table += "| " + test_labels[i] + " | "
    for j in range(len(chemical_elements)):
        result_table += predicted_labels[i][j] + " | "
    result_table += "\n"

print(result_table)
```

Make sure to replace the file paths in the code with the actual paths to your spectroscopic data, object names, and chemical elements files. The `spectra_data.txt` file should contain the spectroscopic data in a comma-separated format, where each row represents the spectrum of a celestial object. The `object_names.txt` file should contain the corresponding object names for each spectrum. The `chemical_elements.txt` file should contain the list of chemical elements to be predicted.

This code uses a random forest classifier from the scikit-learn library to train a model on the training data and predict the object names for the test data. The results are then formatted into a markdown table and printed.

```python
import os
import textract
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize, word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

def extract_information_from_papers(papers_directory):
    extracted_information = []
    
    # Iterate through each file in the papers directory
    for filename in os.listdir(papers_directory):
        if filename.endswith(".pdf"):
            # Extract text from the PDF using textract
            text = textract.process(os.path.join(papers_directory, filename))
            
            # Tokenize the text into sentences
            sentences = sent_tokenize(text.decode('utf-8'))
            
            # Process each sentence
            for sentence in sentences:
                # Tokenize the sentence into words
                words = word_tokenize(sentence)
                
                # Remove stopwords and punctuation
                words = [word.lower() for word in words if word.isalpha() and word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english')]
                
                # Lemmatize the words
                lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
                words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words]
                
                # Extract relevant information based on patterns or keywords
                object_name = extract_object_name(words)
                properties = extract_properties(words)
                references = extract_references(words)
                
                if object_name and properties and references:
                    extracted_information.append({
                        'Object Name': object_name,
                        'Properties': properties,
                        'References': references
                    })
    
    return extracted_information

def extract_object_name(words):
    # Implement logic to extract the object name from the words
    # Return the object name if found, otherwise return None
    pass

def extract_properties(words):
    # Implement logic to extract the properties from the words
    # Return the properties if found, otherwise return None
    pass

def extract_references(words):
    # Implement logic to extract the references from the words
    # Return the references if found, otherwise return None
    pass

# Example usage
papers_directory = '/path/to/papers'
extracted_information = extract_information_from_papers(papers_directory)

# Output the extracted information as a markdown code block
print("```")
for info in extracted_information:
    print(f"Object Name: {info['Object Name']}")
    print(f"Properties: {info['Properties']}")
    print(f"References: {info['References']}")
    print()
print("```")
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/papers` with the actual path to the directory containing the scientific papers you want to analyze. Note that this code is just a starting point and you'll need to implement the logic for extracting the object name, properties, and references based on the structure and content of the scientific papers you're working with.

To design an AI-powered system that generates simulated astronomical images based on user-defined parameters, we can use a combination of image synthesis techniques and deep learning. Here's an example code that outlines the steps involved:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the parameters for the simulated image
object_type = 'star'
position = (100, 100)
observation_conditions = {
    'exposure_time': 10,  # in seconds
    'telescope_diameter': 2.5,  # in meters
    'atmospheric_turbulence': 0.5  # on a scale of 0 to 1
}

# Define a function to generate the simulated image
def generate_simulated_image(object_type, position, observation_conditions):
    # Use deep learning models or image synthesis techniques to generate the image
    # Here, we'll use a simple approach of generating a Gaussian point spread function (PSF)
    # centered at the specified position
    
    # Generate a grid of pixel coordinates
    x, y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(200), np.arange(200))
    
    # Calculate the distance from each pixel to the specified position
    distance = np.sqrt((x - position[0])**2 + (y - position[1])**2)
    
    # Generate the PSF based on the observation conditions
    psf = np.exp(-0.5 * (distance / (observation_conditions['telescope_diameter'] / 2.355))**2)
    
    # Scale the PSF based on the exposure time
    psf *= observation_conditions['exposure_time']
    
    # Add atmospheric turbulence effects
    psf += np.random.normal(0, observation_conditions['atmospheric_turbulence'], psf.shape)
    
    # Normalize the image
    psf /= np.max(psf)
    
    return psf

# Generate the simulated image
simulated_image = generate_simulated_image(object_type, position, observation_conditions)

# Display the simulated image
plt.imshow(simulated_image, cmap='gray')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

This code generates a simulated astronomical image based on the user-defined parameters of object type, position, and observation conditions. It uses a simple approach of generating a Gaussian point spread function (PSF) centered at the specified position. The PSF is then scaled based on the exposure time, and atmospheric turbulence effects are added. Finally, the image is normalized and displayed using matplotlib.

Please note that this code is a simplified example and may not produce realistic or scientifically accurate images. More sophisticated techniques and models can be used to improve the quality and realism of the simulated images.
